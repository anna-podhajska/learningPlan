#### Week 37 (11-17 Sep)
First weekly plan
1) participate the careers week sessions, improve cv and research on companies.
2) Spend min 2hrs/day this week on coding - I already started planning group work on What’s For Lunch project with Usha and Magda, created waffle project and we’ve started defining and assigning tickets. I plan to work on minimum 2 of them this week (re-factor filtering component and create a new component with suggested restaurants).
3) personal project - if there is enough time I will start working on reduxifying my personal project.

#### Week 38 (18-24 Sep)
1. Rose, thorns and bananas from last week
  Rose: We managed to fix the problem with deployment on Heroku (needed help but we learned). Created waffle board for my group and tickets basing on our plan. Also, careers week. Learned about companies in NZ and Wellington, have some ideas where to apply. Thorn: did not do all that planned last week. Banana = got my first SF badge. Never thought I will be doing it.
2. Learning objectives for this week
  - get more SalesForce developer badges (need some more for job application)
  - Create a new component for WFL project (React, Redux, JS)
  - Job-hunting, clean code in repositories
  - Get more familiar with technical testing
3. Plan to achieve those objectives
  - approx 2 hrs a day on coding,
  - use trailhead to get SF developer badges by Tue
  - use links from Rohan to learn more about technical testing

#### Week 39 (25 Sep-01 Oct)
1. Rose (highlights), thorns (lowlights) and bananas (surprises) from your learning time last week
    Rose - solved a problem and wrote helpful piece of code:) (the problem was that our WFL project requires seeds with comments, which resulted in lots of manual work and approx 900 lines of code and 180 objects in seeds, since this was manually done we had errors and lots of duplicates; now we can generate the seeds automatically and have a function in seeds instead of a big object!)
    Thorns - did not do enough on algorithms last week; Bananas - I was on Ember workshop - I really liked it and already did a simple page using Ember!.
2. Your learning objectives for this week
    a) learn more about SF.com for a meeting
    b) work on algorithms, pure JS and re-plan my travel app this week.
3. Work everyday, timebox.
4. min 2hrs a day on coding

#### Week 40 (2-8 Oct)
1. Rose - got through first job interview and going for a second one ... I'm pretty scared but happy :)
    Thorns - did less coding than planned and did not finish all I started last week.
    Bananas - got 5 SF badges pretty quickly.
2. Your learning objectives for this week
    a) prepare myself for interview, practise talking in English mostly
    b) continue work on course started, ember and algorithms.
3.,4. How to achieve this - work everyday, timebox min 2hrs a day on learning.
